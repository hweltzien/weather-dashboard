# weather-dashboard

## Description
After utilizing web-based resources and instructional support, I learned how to use a server-side API to provide current and future weather conditions. I dynamically created HTML elements using JavaScript. I used Day.js to display upcoming dates on the 5-day forecast. Moreover, the Weather Dashboard provides important information for travelers who may need weather conditions for multiple cities.

## Installation

To clone the application, click the green button labeled, "code." Copy the URL for the repository, using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI. Open Git Bash. Change the working directory to the desired location for the cloned directory. Type "git clone" and paste the copied URL. Press "enter" to create your local clone.

## Usage

Upon page load, the user will see the "Weather Dashboard" title in the header, a search form to collect user input on the left, and the local time above a placeholder "weather card." After completing the form and upon clicking the "Search" button, the user will see the date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity populate for today in the weather card. In the footer, the user will see a 5-day forecast with the date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the user-provided city. The search history is saved in local storage and buttons are dynamically created for each saved city name. The user can click the search history buttons to see previously viewed weather conditions.
